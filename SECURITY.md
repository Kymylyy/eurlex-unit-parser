# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest `main` branch is actively supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Preferred process:

1. Use GitHub Security Advisories (private report) if available.
2. If unavailable, open a private communication channel with the maintainer before public disclosure.

Please include:

- affected file/path
- impact description
- reproduction steps
- suggested fix (if known)

We aim to acknowledge reports quickly and coordinate a responsible disclosure timeline.
